Xhilaration
===========

Xhilaration is just a little, top-down, text-based, slow adventure game that I created 	at one time.  I created it mainly to experiment with colous (the batch binary) rendering and to test pause menus, logins, and such.  To use it download it, and run the .bat file and then press the number on your keyboard corresponding to the option you would like to do. Hint: In-game if you want to move use the WSAD keys and if you want to pause press Q.
